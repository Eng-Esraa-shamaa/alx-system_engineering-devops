Issue Summary:
Duration: 2 hours, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM (UTC)
Impact: Users experienced connectivity issues when attempting to connect to the server, resulting in failed connections and frustration.
Root Cause:
The inability to connect to the server was due to attempting to access it without using the necessary private key for authentication.

Timeline:
9:00 AM: Issue identified as failure to connect to the server.
9:15 AM: Engineers initially investigated potential server-side issues, including network configurations and service availability.
9:30 AM: Continued attempts to connect to the server using various credentials and methods led to no success.
10:00 AM: Escalated the issue to senior engineers for further investigation.
10:30 AM: Realized the necessity of using a private key for server authentication after thorough troubleshooting and reviewing system documentation.
11:00 AM: Successfully connected to the server using the appropriate private key.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the connectivity issue was the failure to use the required private key for server authentication:

Root Cause:
Attempting to access the server without using the designated private key led to repeated connection failures.
Resolution:
Once the correct method of authentication (using the private key) was identified and implemented, successful connection to the server was achieved.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To avoid similar connectivity issues and streamline future connections:

Improvements:
Enhance documentation regarding the authentication process and required credentials.

Specific Tasks:
Update and clarify instructions for server access, emphasizing the necessity of the private key.
Implement reminders or notifications within the connection process to ensure proper authentication methods are used.


Conclusion:
The 2-hour server connectivity issue stemmed from attempting to access the server without utilizing the necessary private key for authentication. Through diligent troubleshooting and escalation, the root cause was identified as an authentication oversight. To prevent similar problems in the future, documentation will be updated and improved to ensure clear guidance on the required authentication methods, minimizing user errors during server access attempts.
